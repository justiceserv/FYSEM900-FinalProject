        "I have always been fascinated by ancient history, especially the Roman Empire. Since I was going to be in Naples for a few days, I could not miss the chance to visit Pompeii and Herculaneum, the best preserved examples of Roman urban areas and homes. Before I talk about the tour, it is worth mentioning that many of the works of art like frescoes, mosaics and statues that were found during the excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum are now housed in the National Archaeological Museum in Naples in order to preserve them. I visited the museum the day before my visit of Pompeii and Herculaneum, if you have the time, I highly recommend that you check it out, as it provides a lot more detail and context to what you will see in Pompeii and Herculaneum. I arrived at the meeting point at the Una Hotel, which was about a five minute walk from my Hotel. I waited about 5 minutes before I was picked up and greeted by one of the company representatives. We stopped a few times to pick up other customers at different points in the city, there was terrible traffic and the tour started about half an hour behind schedule. I didn’t mind, I wasn't in a hurry, besides there’s nothing a tour operator can do about traffic in Naples. Anyway, as soon as the last customer had been picked up, our tour leader Silvana introduced herself. During the half hour drive to Pompeii she told us a little about the area, the ruins we’d be visiting and the volcanic eruption of 79 AD that doomed but also preserved the cities. After about a 20 minute drive, we arrived in Herculaneum, where we also had to pay the site’s admission fee of 11 euros. We started our tour by going to what would have been the docks of Herculaneum, where many of its citizens unsuccessfully tried to escape the eruption. We then continued to the villas, they were very similar in style to the wealthy villas we had seen in Pompeii, but because Herculaneum was buried by a volcanic mudslide, everything is better preserved, there are even houses with their original roofs and carbonized original wood. Our last stop on the tour was the Temple of Augustus, with its numerous columns and religious themed frescoes, after that our guided tour was over and we headed back to the van.",
        "The Pompeii archaeological site is located near Naples in the Campania region of southern Italy. It was once a thriving Roman city until it was tragically buried under a thick layer of volcanic ash and pumice during the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The eruption was so intense that it completely destroyed the city, killing thousands of its inhabitants and preserving the town in a remarkable state of preservation. For nearly 1,500 years, Pompeii remained buried and forgotten until its rediscovery in the 18th century. Excavations began in the mid-18th century and continue to this day, revealing an exceptional and unparalleled glimpse into ancient Roman life. The Pompeii archaeological site covers an area of about 170 acres and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It provides a well-preserved snapshot of daily life in a Roman city during the 1st century AD. The excavated ruins include streets, houses, public buildings, temples, theaters, and markets.",
        "The site of Pompeii, the petrified memorial to Vesuvius's eruption in AD 79, is the largest, most accessible, and probably most famous excavation anywhere. A busy commercial center with a population of 10,000–20,000, ancient Pompeii covered about 170 acres on the seaward end of the fertile Sarno Plain. Today it's choked with both the dust of 25 centuries and more than 3 million visitors every year; only by escaping the hordes and lingering along its silent streets can you truly fall under the site's spell. On a quiet backstreet, all you need is a little imagination to picture life in this ancient town. Come in the late afternoon, when the site is nearly deserted, and you will understand the true pleasure of visiting Pompeii. If entering via Porta Marina, the revamped (2021) Antiquarium traces the history of Pompeii from the Samnite era (4th century BC) until AD 79. Among the artifacts displayed are the House of the Golden Bracelet frescoes, the triclinium (dining room) of the House of Menander, and the recently created casts of the Civita Giuliana villa victims. Get your bearings at the Foro (Forum), which served as Pompeii's cultural, political, commercial, and religious hub. You can still see some of the two stories of colonnades that used to line two sides of the square. Like the ancient Greek agora in Athens, the Forum was a busy shopping area, complete with public officials to apply proper standards of weights and measures. Fronted by an elegant portico on the eastern side of the forum is the Macellum, a covered meat and fish market dating to the 2nd century BC. The nearby Terme del Foro (Forum Baths) offered a relaxing respite. It had underground furnaces, the heat from which circulated beneath the floor, rose through flues in the walls, and escaped through chimneys: temperature could be set for cold, lukewarm, or hot. On the southwestern corner is the Basilica, the city's law court and the economic center. These oblong halls were the model for early Christian churches, which had a nave (central aisle) and two side aisles separated by rows of columns. Several homes were captured in various states by the eruption of Vesuvius, each representing a different slice of Pompeiian life. The Casa del Poeta Tragico (House of the Tragic Poet) is a typical middle-class residence. On the floor is a mosaic of a chained dog and the inscription cave canem ('Beware of the dog'). The Casa dei Vettii (House of the Vettii) is the best example of a wealthy merchant's home. There's no more magnificently memorable evidence of Pompeii's devotion to the pleasures of the flesh than the frescoes on view at the Villa dei Misteri (Villa of the Mysteries), a palatial abode built at the far northwestern fringe of Pompeii. Unearthed in 1909 this villa had many rooms, all adorned with frescoes—the finest of which are in the triclinium. Painted in the most glowing Pompeiian red, the panels relate the saga of a young bride and her initiation into the mysteries of the cult of Dionysus, who was a god imported to Italy from Greece and then given the Latin name of Bacchus. Pompeii's other major edifice is the Anfiteatro (Amphitheater), once the ultimate entertainment venue for locals. It provided a range of experiences, though these essentially involved gladiators rather than wild animals. Built in about 70 BC, the oval structure was divided into three seating areas. There were two main entrances—at the north and south ends—and a narrow passage on the west called the Porta Libitinensis, through which the dead were most probably dragged out. To get the most out of Pompeii, rent an audio guide (€8 for one, €13 for two; you'll need to leave an ID card) at Porta Marina, and opt for one of the three itineraries (two hours, four hours, or six hours). If hiring a guide, make sure the guide is registered for an English tour and standing inside the gate; agree beforehand on the length of the tour and the price. You can find a knowledgeable and qualified guide at www.vesuviusvspompeii.com or www.contexttravel.com. A few words about closures: which excavations are open or closed when you arrive might seem a caprice of the gods adorning many of the buildings' walls, but the actual determining factors include availability of staff, geological uncertainty, and restoration. Many excavations are closed long-term for restoration. The Casa del Fauno and Casa del Menandro are usually always open, however, as is the central core of the city, a visit requiring two or more hours itself. In 2019, La Schola Armaturarum—the so-called Casa dei Gladiatori (House of the Gladiators)—was restored after water damage had caused its roof to collapse in 2010, an event that made world headlines and highlighted the need to better protect Pompeii's treasures. It's now open on certain days April through October, an emblem of revitalized preservation efforts and improved management. Check the website for the latest news and exhibitions, and the updated list of visitable buildings at  pompeiisites.org/en/houses. If you're lodging in the town of Pompei, note that there's a convenient entrance to the ruins near the amphitheater off Piazza Santa Immacolata.",
        "Go to see the Roman Forum; the theatre, whose acoustics are so good you don’t need microphones to be heard from the stage; the public baths with looming columns. Built in 70 A.D., the Anfiteatro is the oldest-known Roman amphitheatre in existence. Now covered in grass, it originally held up to 20,000 spectators. The Forum, or Foro in Italian,  and served as ancient Pompeii’s main piazza and leads to many other notable sights, such as the Basilica built in the second century BC, the Temple of Jupiter (Tempio di Giove) which only has one triumphal arch remaining, the city’s Forum Granary and a the nearby Anfiteatro , the city’s primary meat and fish market. Many of the artifacts from Pompeii are housed in the Naples National Archaeological Museum since they were directly ordered to Naples in the 1700s by the Neapolitan king. History and archaeology buffs should absolutely visit the museum – it offers the best look into the art of Pompeii that still exists, which ranges from enormous statues and mosaics to intimate objects of every day life. Pompeii archaeological site has all of the ruins but the Naples Archaeological Museum houses all of the objects found during excavations.",
        "I love exploring the world of ancient Rome, with its grand architecture, fascinating culture, and stories of larger-than-life leaders. But since many of the 2,000-year-old empire's landmarks are reduced to ruins, it can be hard to make sense of the stones and rubble left behind. To get a clearer picture of what everyday life in ancient Rome was really like, visit the well-preserved (and unlucky) city of Pompeii. Located just south of Naples, Pompeii was founded in 600 BC and eventually grew from its Greek and Etruscan roots into a bustling Roman trading city and port. Neither rich nor poor, Pompeii was a typical middle-class town. To serve its 20,000 residents, the city boasted more than 40 bakeries, 130 bars, and plenty of public baths. Being a port, it also had brothels, restaurants, and entertainment venues that catered to sailors from all over the Roman world — many of whom didn't speak a lick of Latin. Most of Pompeii's buildings were covered in brilliant white ground-marble stucco, making it an impressive sight. And from its richly decorated forum, people had a postcard-perfect view of the looming volcano, Mount Vesuvius. Then on October 24, AD 79, everything changed. At about 1 p.m., Vesuvius sent a mushroom cloud of ash, dust, and rocks 12 miles into the sky. It spewed for 18 hours straight, as winds blew the cloud south toward the city. The white-gray ash settled like a heavy snow on Pompeii, its weight eventually collapsing roofs and floors (but leaving walls standing). Though most of Pompeii's residents had fled, 2,000 stayed behind. A bad move, because the next morning a red-hot pyroclastic flow struck Pompeii, dealing a fatal blow to those who had remained, and burying the city under 30 feet of volcanic debris. After the eruption, people from nearby towns tried in vain to find the buried city. Because Pompeii was a major port, people naturally searched for it near the sea. But the eruption had filled in the harbor and pushed the coastline out, meaning Pompeii now lay inland — and its location would remain a mystery for more than 1,500 years. In 1599, Pompeii was accidentally rediscovered during construction of a canal. Serious excavations began in 1748 and are still ongoing, making Pompeii the longest-continually-excavated site in the world. Ironically, the ash that had destroyed Pompeii also ensured its preservation, leaving it frozen in time. As a result, its ruins offer the best look anywhere at life in an ancient Roman town, with its gridded street plan, villas and homes, commercial buildings, public baths, and colorful frescoes left remarkably intact. Pompeii also exhibits small signs of everyday life. In the town's many 'fast food' joints, holes in the counter show where containers once held food for hungry customers to grab as a quick meal. Public drinking fountains still stand along the city's main streets, many of which would have been lined with stalls and jammed with customers from sunup to sundown. And if you look closely at some of the walls, bright red graffiti pops out exclaiming that Julius was here. Of course, the most compelling scenes in Pompeii are provided by its (permanent) residents. While excavating, modern archaeologists detected hollow spaces in the volcanic debris that were created when victims' bodies decomposed. By gently filling in the holes with plaster, the archaeologists created molds of the Pompeiians who were caught in the disaster. The plaster casts show remarkable details — the folds of togas, the straps of sandals, the pained expressions on victims' faces. Signs of animals have also been found, including a saddled-up horse that appears ready to carry its master to safety. To complement your Pompeii visit, stop by the National Archaeological Museum in Naples. The museum is home to Pompeii's finest art and artifacts, including a display of erotic frescoes that were considered so bawdy that by the time they made it here, in 1819, they could be viewed only with permission from the king. (From Naples, Pompeii is easily reached via the comfy Campania Express train, the cheaper — but shabby — Circumvesuviana commuter train, or shuttle buses run by CitySightseeing and Capri Sightseeing.) Excavations at Pompeii experienced a renaissance in 2018, when new artifacts and skeletons were discovered in a section of the city yet to be fully unearthed. New discoveries since then include more skeletons, vivid frescoes, an ancient snack stand, and evidence that the eruption had taken place two months later than historians had long thought. With fresh secrets sure to be revealed in coming years, evocative Pompeii will be worth visiting again and again.",
        "wow wow wow … if you get the opportunity to go here then I would highly recommend the trip. book guide… their knowledge is incredible and it is amazing to hear the history surrounding the places you visit. it is hot so make sure you wear a hat as there is no shelter.",
        "Most of the artifacts are in the museum of Naples (also go). We have a guide. The bigger theatre is under construction, the amphitheater is too far to walk in the summer heat. You can easily spend the whole day here. However, in summer the ruins are very hot. There are no fountains in the ruins and there is almost no shade. Bring sunscreen, umbrellas and three times more water than you think you need.",
        "Pompeii Ancient City ruins! Worth a visit! Think back to the sad scene of 2000 years ago! One brilliant night does not exist!",
        "I suspect most go to tick it off their 'bucket list'. This is a daft American notion, and my view is if you have such a thing put at the top 'tear up the bucket list'. The reality is that one or two days is completely insufficient to begin even to scratch the surface of this place but you can see the remaining houses of the 'important' residents (including magistrates, politicians) but I never understand why we fawn over politicians. To me they are essential only in the same way sewers are vital to cities their usefulness in each case is that they shift. In regard to magistrates, judges etc they do not dispense justice rather the law. There's very little relationship between the law and justice and in most cases any similarity is purely coincidental. Yes I'm a Cynic. There's also the public arenas to see here. These are easily identified like the forum, the sewage system, public toilets, the water supply system, a fast food restaurant, a bath house and the red light area, but another reality is you will need a guide not just to guide you to what you are looking for and at, but to get you back out again to where you entered if you have a taxi or coach to return to. There's at least three different exits. It's a truly huge site with cobble and broken stones underfoot. You need a great degree of physical stamina to get about and it's sure not for the faint-hearted or weak limbed. As with so many of these sites there's a fair number of spivs trying to sell you everything from guides to devices you can wear to self guide (they will take a big ££ deposit to secure the equipment) to ice cream and coffee purveyors - suffice to say that they will rob you blind given half of half the chance. If you can organise all you need before you get there it'll be much easier and relaxed. I've been a few times before and have a slight advantage knowing some Latin but I wouldn't return. The only reason we went this time was we were with friends who hadn't been before and wanted to go.....they said something to do with a bucket list. Bah, humbug.",
        "An amazing archaeological site filled with stories of the 20-30,000 people who lived there. Well maintained this city is filled with all the things you would find in a city of today. The ruins are well preserved yet you are allowed to get up close and personal to the artifacts. Recommend you hire a tour guide so they can get you to the important points of interest. It is a massive city and a typical tour is 3-4 hours of which you will explore less than 10% of the city. Lots of cafes and shops right outside the entrance. A cameo factory is located right next door that has some amazing pieces albeit a bit higher cost due to proximity to this major tourist attraction.",
        "We arranged a 4 hour tour, from our hotel that included, transportation, guide and skip the line tickets. For me, it was worth having all this prearranged and organized. We were able to enjoy Pompeii relaxed and worry free. We had a comfortable ride and after we arrived, we were handed our tickets and walked right in. Having a knowledgeable guide describe the historic event, structures, art and city made the visit much more interesting than just walking about on our own. Pompeii is beautiful, from it's uneven stone streets to it broken columns and buildings, built long before the birth of Christ. It's amazing to stand there and see something that old and historic for yourself. You could easily spend a day there, but for me, 4 hours was just about right.",
        "The Pompeii Ruins really are a sight to behold. Lots of history across every city block (including fast food and brothels!) along with a number of preserved areas. Be sure to go with a tour guide - and allot plenty of time!",
        "Hasn't everyone heard of Pompeii, the famous ancient city near Naples? The city was buried under as much as 20 feet of volcanic ash in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The city was largely preserved under the ash and the excavated city now offers a unique image of what life was like as it was frozen in time at the moment it was buried. There is enough to see here that you could easily spend a full day or more. I had three hours of a guided tour which brought us through the basilica area, through preserved homes, uncovered baths and of course, the brothel. The tour guide was so enamored with the paintings on the walls there, the stone penises over door frames and such. I guess he thought that these titillations were important. Pompeii is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is easily accessible by train from Naples in less than half an hour. I would suggest a guided tour so you don't miss too much. There are plenty of subtle details that are worth pointing out.",
        "Pompeii is so vast and an incredible historical site to walk through. I think they could really improve the tourist experience though. There are very few signs throughout the ruins, so you can only really learn with a tour guide or with an audioguide. It was very difficult to navigate by myself and figure out which sites to see and in which order to go about this huge complex. When I went to buy my ticket, they said the card machine was broken, and you could only pay with cash or go on their website to buy a ticket, except service was very poor there, and they didn't have wifi. I've never been to a major tourist site and been told all the card machines were broken. This was very disappointing, especially with how famous and popular Pompeii is.",
        "A must see in the area. This was an amazing place. We prearranged a guide to meet us to give us a private tour as we only had 2 hours. We were efficient and saw all the highlights, wealthy house, the baths, plaster people remains, frescos, theatre, and forum to just name a few. I loved the frescos. I didn't take a ton of pics because it was fun to just focus and imagine the life and character of this city. The size of the excavated area is massive. Two hours was not enough. It's interesting to hear the stories of how it's thought these people lived based on what they left behind but we will never really know for sure. Our guide, Serena, was excellent. Full of info but driven to ensure we used our time wisely. Heads up, our entry line was held up a few times by people that had purchased online tickets without the scanner working well off your phone. Print them out if you can for the best results.",
        "MIND BLOWING EXPERIENCE ! Many of us have read, heard or seen stuff on TV about legendary Pompeii but until you are actually here...you know nothing ! The sheer magnitude of what is still an ACTIVE archaeological dig site is overwhelming. Sunday, Sept 24th was the last morning of our 4 day vacation in beautiful Salerno. Eugenio our limo driver picked us up at our apartment for the long drive to our next vacation stop....Rome. BUT FIRST ! Our travel agent had organized a private tour guide to show us around the Pompeii Archaeological Park. WHAT A THRILL ! We hooked up with Pino our wonderful tour guide outside the main gate at around 9.30am. There was a huge line of people waiting to get in. Being on a private guided tour we were let straight in. Nothing really prepares you for the visual spectacle you are about to see. Pino our highly informed tour guide is an archaeologist so there was extra weight to everything she told us about Pompeii. THERE'S MORE ! In fact we got lucky with the timing of our visit because we saw a newly excavated villa which had been opened to visitors in just the last month. Pino explained that this huge opulent villa which contained summer and winter residences would been owned by a very wealthy family or individual. A BIT SCARY ! Of course the dormant Mount Vesuvius was very prominent on the horizon. After about 2 hours we completed our private guided tour. We left with memories we will never forget...and a ton of photos ! ",
        "This place was always a childhood dream for me to visit, as I had read about this site as a child. I have been to many ruins in the UK, India, Egypt and Mexico. It is quite well preserved for a place of great devastation by Mount Vesuvius. The entry point has a gift shop with many historical books, children's items, souvenirs but the biggest draw for me was the casts of some citizens who were victims of the volcano. The gift shop is a must see for that. It is right before the entry off of the Main Street. Inside, we walked into the coliseum which was surprisingly intact. There is a gallery of pop culture that was featured in the dark corridors. A garden was reconstructed by the historians that gave us a small glimpse of what it looked like in the time. Frescos in the house of Julia were still visible. You can walk along the ancient stone streets to see how the citizens traveled in the period. Along the streets are remnants of a historic town with thermopoliums where food was prepared by vendors and old houses by many aristocrats who lived there. A remnant of an old brothel still exists here showing the small rooms where patrons visited. The main square where their government operated are in classic ruins but it is impressive to see what still remains. The sidewalks have some access to strollers and wheelchairs, though some areas can be tricky. The elaborate construction of the steam baths are still there. Many of which are preserved and give you an idea of how ingenious the culture was in the period. There is an art display of many artifacts that were recovered in the ruins that is worth seeing. Frescos, statues, wall art and some paintings remain. It took about 2.5 to 3 hours to cover most of the town. 2/3 of the town has been uncovered but 1/3 remains untouched. There were a few water stations for people to refresh themselves but food and drink are not available. You have to pass through a security checkpoint, and large baggage, large backpacks and luggage are not allowed. It is definitely a worthwhile place for visitors of all ages. The Herculaneum is also worthy of a visit, too, in Naples. Many exhibits are labeled in Italian and English. Tour guides are available outside of the entrances for hire or you can choose to use a guidebook or app from the AppStore that geocache the various landmarks. It was well worth the visit to Pompeii ruins! It is not far from Sorrento or Naples. I do recommend staying hydrated or you can get exhausted since the humidity is high here. Also wear comfortable shoes. There are some steeper slopes that one must navigate in some areas and ground is uneven so be careful, be safe and have fun!",
        "There isn't a lot of shade and this place is huge! You're going to sweat like a pig that ate too much pepperoni. I don't think I've ever sweated as much as I did here in my entire life. I was drenched from top to bottom. I could barely move as my clothes were attached to my skin because of all the sweat. Still, it was worth it. You'll see the molten casts of the people who passed away as well as the remains of a lot. Almost got into a fist fight with one of the tour guides because he decided he was priority and decided to cut in front of my even though I had been waiting to take a picture for awhile. Still, in the end after a yelling match he backed down. Overall, a crazy experience and one that is worth the hassle and pain you will have to endure.",
        "We had an incredible time exploring Pompeii and taking a peek into the life of the Romans prior to Mount Vesuvius' eruption in 79 AD. We had a two hour guided tour of this city frozen in time, and honestly I could have spent plenty more hours wandering the streets of Pompeii! Our tour guide is born and raised in a small town just outside of Pompeii, and she was brimming with knowledge. She really helped paint the picture of life in Pompeii and what life was like so long ago. I was surprised to learn how civilized the folks of Pompeii were! Irrigation systems, street signs, grab & go food spots (essentially fast food), and entertainment. I loved seeing the theatres where Romans spent so much of their time, the homes with gorgeous tiles and artwork, and of course, the bathhouses! When you think of Pompeii, you often think of the casts of bodies from the individuals who suffered the awful tragedy. To my surprise, many of these have been transferred to the National Archaeological Museum in Naples, but we were still able to see one here, which was truly so devastating despite it being so long ago. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes (lots of walking and so much to see!) and sunscreen because there aren't many shady areas. If you're able to organize a guided tour, I really think this is the best way to get the most out of your visit.",
        "Tips: 1. Opt for guided or private tours to delve into the stories behind each place. 2. Allocate a full day to explore all sites, including villas. 3. Bring plenty of water for the day-long walk and exploration. 4. Wear your most comfortable shoes for walking. 5. Store large backpacks or luggage in the designated area before entering. Lastly, savor the experience of a city frozen in time! 😊", 
        "Recommend buying tickets online and I took the audio guide which was very helpful and informative. Just an amazing place and even after 6 hours I hadn't seen it all. Train and train station definitely can be improved. Facilities being closed like the second cafeteria left long lines for food. Luckily free water helps. Go early in the morning and see the most popular things to avoid the crowds and tour groups.",
        "Pompeii is like stepping into a time machine. Actually, that’s what the tragic eruption did: preserved the ancient city for centuries, untouched, frozen in time. You get to see what life was like in ancient times, walk through streets, and even peek into houses and shops. It's like a real-life adventure where you can uncover secrets of the past, from the love for beauty and art to the amazing worship temples. It’s clearly visible that the former society was well organized, with clear social rankings and attributions. What’s super exciting is that new discoveries are frequently made. Prepare spending at least half day and bring good shoes and water. There are a few refill points and some shops where you can buy food and refreshments.",
        "Incredible,amazing with lots of history and breathtaking views -must go old city-Pompeii,it’s a gem 💜I was there whole day and feel like it was not enough for me. Advice bring your own food and water as the queue in coffee shop is really long.And enjoy your trip to the past☺️",
        "Amazing - and surprisingly huge. Probably the best view into ancient Roman life outside the opulence of Rome. Walking through the homes, seeing the painted walls, in tact wall paintings and mosaics is a real experience. Walking down the actual paved streets. Can get very crowded - we went in April and there were some nice quiet areas to soak up the atmosphere. Book in advance !",
        "When deciding part of our Honeymoon would be a trip to Rome I knew I had to find a tour to Pompeii. Being so close I couldn't waste the opportunity to visit one of my most dreamed locations. I found a tour that included a bullet train ride to Naples, taking just over an hour.. much better than a coach trip! The site itself is staggering. On a much larger scale than I ever imagined and in a much better condition too, considering what happened!! A tour is definitely recommended, our tour guide took us to all the best sites to view and was packed with amazing information. Without a tour you could definitely spend the whole day walking around the different streets. Absolutely amazing, this is a trip I will never forget."
